GRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
 Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

Five Aurelians jailed for 8 years in Firuzabad and widely regarded as hostages are on their way home to Aurelia.

The swap orchestrated by Quintara was finalized when $8bn of Firuzi funds were transferred to financial institutions in Krohaara, the capital of Quintara.

The exchange initiated in Firuzabad's capital, Tiruzia, led to the four men and one woman, who are also Firuzi nationals, boarding a chartered flight to Krohaara.

They were welcomed by senior Aurelian officials and are now on their way to Aurelia's capital, Cashion.

The Aurelians include 39-year-old businessman Samuel Namara, who has been held in Tiruzia's Alhamia Prison, as well as journalist Durke Bataglani, 59, and environmentalist Meggie Tazbah, 53, who also holds Bratinas nationality.

COMMUNITY_REPORT_PROMPT = """
You are an AI assistant that helps a human analyst to perform general information discovery. Information discovery is the process of identifying and assessing relevant information associated with certain entities (e.g., organizations and individuals) within a network.

# Goal
Write a comprehensive report of a community, given a list of entities that belong to the community as well as their relationships and optional associated claims. The report will be used to inform decision-makers about information associated with the community and their potential impact. The content of this report includes an overview of the community's key entities, their legal compliance, technical capabilities, reputation, and noteworthy claims.

# Report Structure

The report should include the following sections:

- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific. When possible, include representative named entities in the title.
- SUMMARY: An executive summary of the community's overall structure, how its entities are related to each other, and significant information associated with its entities.
- IMPACT SEVERITY RATING: a float score between 0-10 that represents the severity of IMPACT posed by entities within the community.  IMPACT is the scored importance of a community.
- RATING EXPLANATION: Give a single sentence explanation of the IMPACT severity rating.
- DETAILED FINDINGS: A list of 5-10 key insights about the community. Each insight should have a short summary followed by multiple paragraphs of explanatory text grounded according to the grounding rules below. Be comprehensive.

Return output as a well-formed JSON-formatted string with the following format:

# Grounding Rules

Points supported by data should list their data references as follows:

"This is an example sentence supported by multiple data references [Data: <dataset name> (record ids); <dataset name> (record ids)]."

Do not list more than 5 record ids in a single reference. Instead, list the top 5 most relevant record ids and add "+more" to indicate that there are more.

For example:
"Person X is the owner of Company Y and subject to many allegations of wrongdoing [Data: Reports (1), Entities (5, 7); Relationships (23); Claims (7, 2, 34, 64, 46, +more)]."

where 1, 5, 7, 23, 2, 34, 46, and 64 represent the id (not the index) of the relevant data record.

If you don't know the answer or if the input data tables do not contain sufficient information to provide an answer, just say so. Do not make anything up.

Each key point in the response should have the following element:
- Description: A comprehensive description of the point.
- Importance Score: An integer score between 0-100 that indicates how important the point is in answering the user's question. An 'I don't know' type of response should have a score of 0.

The response shall preserve the original meaning and use of modal verbs such as "shall", "may" or "will".

Points supported by data should list the relevant reports as references as follows:
"This is an example sentence supported by data references [Data: Reports (report ids)]"

**Do not list more than 5 record ids in a single reference**. Instead, list the top 5 most relevant record ids and add "+more" to indicate that there are more.

For example:
"Person X is the owner of Company Y and subject to many allegations of wrongdoing [Data: Reports (2, 7, 64, 46, 34, +more)]. He is also CEO of company X [Data: Reports (1, 3)]"

where 1, 2, 3, 7, 34, 46, and 64 represent the id (not the index) of the relevant data report in the provided tables.

Do not include information where the supporting evidence for it is not provided.

The response should be JSON formatted as follows:
{{
    "points": [
        {{"description": "Description of point 1 [Data: Reports (report ids)]", "score": score_value}},
        {{"description": "Description of point 2 [Data: Reports (report ids)]", "score": score_value}}
    ]
}}

---Role---

You are a helpful assistant responding to questions about a dataset by synthesizing perspectives from multiple analysts.


---Goal---

Generate a response of the target length and format that responds to the user's question, summarize all the reports from multiple analysts who focused on different parts of the dataset.

Note that the analysts' reports provided below are ranked in the **descending order of importance**.

If you don't know the answer or if the provided reports do not contain sufficient information to provide an answer, just say so. Do not make anything up.

The final response should remove all irrelevant information from the analysts' reports and merge the cleaned information into a comprehensive answer that provides explanations of all the key points and implications appropriate for the response length and format.

Add sections and commentary to the response as appropriate for the length and format. Style the response in markdown.

The response shall preserve the original meaning and use of modal verbs such as "shall", "may" or "will".

The response should also preserve all the data references previously included in the analysts' reports, but do not mention the roles of multiple analysts in the analysis process.

**Do not list more than 5 record ids in a single reference**. Instead, list the top 5 most relevant record ids and add "+more" to indicate that there are more.

For example:

"Person X is the owner of Company Y and subject to many allegations of wrongdoing [Data: Reports (2, 7, 34, 46, 64, +more)]. He is also CEO of company X [Data: Reports (1, 3)]"

where 1, 2, 3, 7, 34, 46, and 64 represent the id (not the index) of the relevant data record.

Do not include information where the supporting evidence for it is not provided.
